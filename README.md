Overview 

Behavior intervention therapists provide services for children with various diagnoses and challenges. Each clientâ€™s care is personalized to fit their needs and must be adjusted as the client masters new skills and problem behaviors are reduced. This involves recording data reporting their progress each session and regular monitoring to adjust the goals to ensure the best possible care is being given. The traditional method of recording this data has been writing it on paper, admin staff manually entering it, and then a supervisor graphing and interpreting it. This causes a whole host of problems and has recently been replaced in most settings by Electronic Health Record (EHR) software with varying degrees of success. Implementing these tools has been primary done at a corporate level for larger agencies as EHR software is often costly to implement. Few options exist for independent providers and small agencies. Project Code Name Jellyfish will be the first tool in a suite of tools intended to meet the needs of these unincorporated entities providing ABA (applied behavior analysis) or adjacent services modularly. 

A provider in this field will typically interact with 2-3 clients per day, 5 days a week. These interactions will usually be with the same caseload of 2-6 individuals. Each case will have 3-5 skills they are working to develop and may also have 1 or 2 problem behaviors that are monitored for frequency, duration, or both. Each of these skills or behaviors will have 1-10 trials recorded for the purpose of monitoring progress. Meaning these provider will create a rough average of 350 new datapoints a week. A small agency may have 5-10 provider on staff entering 1750-3500 datapoints a week for their 62-125 appointments a week for 10-60 clients. Large agencies multiply this drastically and often also provide additional services that have similar data needs. All of this does not even account for the plethora of treatment plans, assessments, and authorizations on file for each participant required by insurance and state agencies. 

Project Jellyfish will form the backbone of daily data entry for skill trials performed by the provider with the client.
